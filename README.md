### Steps to Run

1. Install and launch R. I like to use [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/).
2. Create a directory called *sentiment_analysis*. From the command line: *mkdir sentiment_analysis*
3. Open up that directory. From the command line: *cd sentiment_analysis*
4. Clone this repository. From the command line: *git clone git@github.com:kabirnayeem99/sentiment_analysis.git*
5. Open the file *sentiment_analysis.R* in RStudio.
6. Make sure your working directory is the *sentiment_analysis* directory. From RStudio, you can go to Tools -> Set Working Directory -> Choose Directory. Or you can run the command *setwd('path/to/directory')*
7. Select 'Run' to execute the program.
